iOS: 9.0
XCode: 7.0

This project demonstrates how to set up automated UI Testing in Xcode.
This method does not use UI Automation, which is a Javascript-based framework.
Instead, it uses the XCTest and Accessibility frameworks to run and validate the tests.

Method:
Create a new Target. Choose iOS->Test->iOS UI Testing Bundle.
	A new group and XCTestCase sub-class is created with an empty test example method.
